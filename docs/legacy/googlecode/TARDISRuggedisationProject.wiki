#summary A Monash University / VeRSI Collaboration to strengthen the data workflow and federated aspects of TARDIS

= Project Phases =

==Phase 1==
  * Strengthening the feedback and logging of TARDIS data ingest process (internally for system and admins)
  * Increasing the feedback on an experiments' ingest state for display to the user (ie. transfer pending)
  * Incorporating feedback on experiments' ingest state of federated nodes into Australian Synchrotron systems
  * Implementing notifications (ie. email) for both admins and users on experiment success and failure

==Phase 2==

  * The ability to retry failed workflow components (perhaps with a message bus)
  * Eliminating the need for the central index of federated nodes to be in a single point of failure
  * Refactoring the django architecture for better skinning/database access/visual templating/applications
  * Reports for all levels of users (researcher / admin / product owner)

==Phase 3==
  * Federated search sophistication: the ability to seamlessly search across federated nodes from tardis.edu.au
  * A metadata definition host server so federated nodes can subscribe to it and receive new and updated metadata definitions across the federation
