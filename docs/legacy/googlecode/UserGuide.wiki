= Register with ANDS =

ANDS is the Australian National Data Service (www.ands.org.au; funded to June 2013) which publishes metadata (descriptions of datasets) to encourage reuse and sharing of data in Australia and internationally. Metadata which can be added in myTardis includes: 
  * Name of the collection
  * Description of the collection
  * Related documents of the collection
  * Originating source of the collection
  * Licence of the collection
  * Digitial Object Identifier "DOI" for the collection
  * Domain specific profiles

Metadata allows facilitates machine understanding of understanding for discovery, access and reuse powerful search tools can find and use your experiment data.

*Registration workflow*
 
 # Navigate to an experiment you wish to register with ANDS/RDA and then select the 'ANDS Register' tab.

The current recommendation of the university is to choose a Creative Commons Licence. For more details on the Creative Commons Licence structure see: http://creativecommons.org.au/. If you have any concerns around licensing or public sharing of your data we recommend you seek legal advice.
