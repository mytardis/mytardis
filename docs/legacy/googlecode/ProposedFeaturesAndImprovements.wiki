!MyTardis is currently the focus of two independent projects:

  * EIF019 @ MeRC - The Monash eResearch Centre, which initiated MyTardis development
  * MeCAT - An ANDS funded joint project between the Australian Synchrotron and ANSTO

The roadmap for each project is presented below.

Note that this page should only contain links to items that are either not yet started or are still in progress.  Completed items should be moved to the [Contents Table of Contents].

= MeRC MyTardis Roadmap =

  * Annotations<br>Add support for annotations.  This will need to consider data versioning and derived datasets.
  * [DataStaging] Ability to stage data (via mount) and define new experiments
  * [DataUpload] Ability to upload data via a web interface
  * [DataAnnotate] Ability to annotate data with new parameters via web / edit current parameters
  * [ParameterSets] Multiple parameter sets based on varying/repeating schema
  * [ExperimentRelations] Ability to map experiment relations (derived experiments / raw data experiments etc)
  * [WebServices] Web service access to experiment / dataset / datafile information
  * [EventDrivenDesign]
  * [ClassBasedArchitecture] Class-based architecture
  * [PluginArchitecture] (django project / multiple apps)
  * [RichParameters] Richer parameter types and multiple parameter sets per object
  * [RichGroupAccess] Finer-grained access permissions and user groups
  * [VisualThemes]
  * [SimpleExperimentParser] Experiment parser rewrite
  * [CrystallographyDatabaseCleanup] Remove discipline specific models
  * [SoftwareRobustness] (logging, testing, packaging, configuring)
  * [GenericSearchWithModules] A generic search interface, and the ability to add custom search modules
  * Support for themes


= MeCAT MyTardis Roadmap =

== Schema Modifications ==

  * Generalise PdbID<br>Support references to domain specific databases other than the Protein Crystallography database.
  * Generalise Citation to handle both publications the Experiment is dependent on, and publications resulting from the Experiment.

== Authentication ==

  * Ensure that MyTardis can handle multiple simultaneous authentication methods.
  * Ensure support for Shibboleth, VBL

== Authorisation ==

Extend the authorisation model to handle:

  * Owner
  * Id
  * Group
  * Date
  * Location
  * Attribute (e.g. publication link present)

For details, please see AuthorisationEngineAlt (AuthorisationEngine was the original discussion).

== ARDC Harvesting ==

  * Support for [RIFCSoverOAIPMH RIF-CS over OAI-PMH].

== Miscellaneous ==

  * Audit
    * All modifications should be recorded
    * Analysis of who is accessing what data
  * Enhanced searching
    * Auto-generated search page from schema
    * Complex search strings, e.g. ANDs and ORs
    * Trac style advanced search page
  * Ingestion
    * Transaction control and rollback
