#summary There are some crystallography-specific database tables that need removal and incorporation into a more generic structure

== Tables for Removal ==

Pdbid (protein databank), Citation

== Proposed Solution ==

Pdbid and citation are simple textual key-value parameters that should be stored alongside an experiment. Currently one can only store parameters associated with a datafile and a dataset. There'll need to be support built for storing parameters at experiment level also.

This would require modification of:

Experiment parser(s)
Database models
Database insertion code
Search code
Visual Templates

Though this may look painful, it's not a major change.
