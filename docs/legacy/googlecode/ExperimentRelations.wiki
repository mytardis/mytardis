#summary Currently experiments have no concept of relation to other experiments

= Details =

This is born from an idea that raw datasets should be read-only as a record of something that came off an instrument. Derived (processed) files, including results should form their own experiment and point back to the original.

The process above would require two changes
  * Categorisation of experiments, likely from a pre-defined list (ie. raw/processed/results)
  * A pointer to the id of a linked experiment, and the relation (parent?/child?/derived from?)

Perhaps child experiments could store a link to their parent, and a bi-directional link could be obtained via model query.
