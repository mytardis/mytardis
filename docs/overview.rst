At the simplest level, the experimental data is simply a collection of files
(Datafiles), which are grouped in to Datasets, which are grouped in to
Experiments:

(Please note that the schema is only partially shown in the diagram above)

At each level, Experiment, Dataset and Datafile, administrator defined
parameters may be added, grouped in to Parameter Sets.

Tardis doesnâ€™t impose any interpretation on what is considered an Experiment
or Dataset.  Examples of how datasets may be grouped are: by sample, by
instrument settings, or as a time sequence, e.g. artificially aging a material
and investigating the effects.
