	<strong>TARDIS</strong> is a multi-institutional collaborative
	venture that aims to facilitate the archiving and sharing of
	raw X-ray diffraction images (collectively known as a
	'dataset') from the protein crystallography community.
	Whereas the model coordinates and (less often) the structure
	factors (processed experimental data) are stored in
	the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">PDB</a> the
	raw diffraction data is often not available. Addressing this
	shortcoming is the central aim of TARDIS. There are several
	reasons why we feel this is important
	(see <a href="/about">about</a>), which can be summarised as:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The availability of raw data is extremely useful for the
	  development of improved methods of image analysis and data
	  processing.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Fostering the archival of raw data at an institutional level
	  is one the best ways of ensuring that this data is not lost
	  (laboratory archives are typically volatile)
	</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
