'''
A custom method can be provided for calculating checksum for a storage class,
e.g.

CALCULATE_CHECKSUM_METHODS = {
    'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage':
        'tardis.apps.s3utils.utils.calculate_checksum'
}

The DataFileObject class's calculate_checksum method checks for a storage class
match in the CALCULATE_CHECKSUM_METHODS dict, and if one is not found, it calls
the classic compute_checksum method which uses the file_object to calculate the
checksum one chunk at a time.  For some storage backends (e.g. S3), representing
the file as file-like object with Django's file storage API is not the most
efficient way to calculate the checksum.

'''
If a new DataFile is created in a Dataset whose files are all stored in the same
storage box, then the new file will be stored in the same storage box, irrespective
of the "default" StorageBoxAttribute.

The mytardis-app-mydata app has its own logic for determining the appropriate
storage box for uploads from a MyData instance.  When a MyData instance
(an "Uploader") is approved, it will be assigned a storage box which should
be used for DataFileObjects created from MyData uploads.
