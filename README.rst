README for MyTARDIS
===================

MyTARDIS is a multi-institutional collaborative venture that facilitates
the archiving and sharing of data and metadata collected at major
facilities such as the Australian Synchrotron and ANSTO and within
Institutions.

An example of the benefit of a system such as MyTARDIS in the protein
crystallography community is that while the model coordinates and (less
often) the structure factors (processed experimental data) are stored in
the community Protein Data Bank (PDB) the raw diffraction data is often
not available. There are several reasons why this is important, which
can be summarised as:

-  The availability of raw data is extremely useful for the development
   of improved methods of image analysis and data processing.

-  Fostering the archival of raw data at an institutional level is one
   the best ways of ensuring that this data is not lost (laboratory
   archives are typically volatile).
