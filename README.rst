Overview
--------
MyTardis began at Monash University to solve the problem of users needing to
store large datasets and share them with collaborators online. Its particular
focus is on integration with scientific instruments, instrument facilities and
research storage and computing infrastructure; to address the challenges of data
storage, data access, collaboration and data publication.

Key features for users
----------------------
The MyTardis data management platform is a software solution that manages research data and the associated metadata. MyTardis handles the underlying storage to ensure that data is securely archived and provides access to the data through a web portal. Data hosted in MyTardis can also be accessed via SFTP.

Key features for instrument facilities
--------------------------------------
MyTardis takes care of distributing data to your users. Its instrument integration technology takes care of securely and automatically shifting data from instrument to repository and makes it accessible by the right users.

Developing for MyTardis
-----------------------
MyTardis is mostly written in the `Python programming language <https://www.python.org/>`_ and is built on top of the `Django web framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. A complete installation of the service also includes an `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/>`_ index, a `RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_-based task queue, an `Nginx <http://nginx.org/>`_ server, and a `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database.

To set up and manage these services we employ the `SaltStack <https://saltstack.com/>`_ orchestration software and cloud technologies.

Releases
--------

The default branch on GitHub is ``develop``. This is the cutting edge
development version. Please DO NOT use this in production, as it may have bugs
that eat your data.

The ``master`` branch is the current stable release with all the latest bugfixes
included. It will move to newer versions automatically. Follow this branch
if you want to stay up to date in a production environment.

Each version has its own branch named by version number. At the time of
writing, the latest release is ``3.8.1``, tagged from the ``series-3.8``
branch. Follow this branch for your production installation and
perform version upgrades manually.

Each bugfix or set of fixes bumps the minor version and each new release is
tagged, eg. ``3.8.2``. Use tagged releases if you are paranoid about changes to
the code you have not tested yourself.

To follow development, please see the contributing section below.
