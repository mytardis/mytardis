## First working day after 7th

Stable branch should be created after the 7th. The 7th is the last date to reliably get things in.

- [ ] Create the `Pick into series-X.Y` label if it doesn't exist: [https://github.com/mytardis/mytardis/labels](https://github.com/mytardis/mytardis/labels)
  - Label name: `Pick into series-X.Y`
  - Description: ``Pull requests to cherry-pick into the `series-X.Y` branch.``
  - Color: `#5319e7`
- [ ] In Slack MyTardis `#general` channel:

    ```
    @channel

    I am about to create the `series-X.Y` branch. Everything merged into `develop`
    after this point will go into next month's release. Only regression and security fixes
    will be cherry-picked into `series-X.Y`.

    If your PR is targeting this release and has been approved but hasn't
    been merged yet, please ping me here. Also, please update your pull requests with the correct milestone (`X.Y` for this release).

    Please submit regression and security fixes as PRs to `develop` and ensure that
    they are labelled with the `Pick into series-X.Y` label.
    ```
- [ ] Merge any **approved** PRs into `develop`
- [ ] Ensure that semaphore tests are passing on `develop`
- [ ] PR any final notable changes to `docs/CHANGELOG.rst` and ping someone to merge it.
- [ ] Create branch `series-X.Y` from `develop`
- [ ] Activate the `series-X.Y` branch build on ReadTheDocs.
- [ ] Create a PR against `develop` that increments the version numbers to `X.{Y + 1}.0`:
  - [ ] `README.md`
  - [ ] `package.json`
  - [ ] Add new section to `docs/CHANGELOG.rst`
  - [ ] `tardis/__init__.py`


## RC1

- Follow the [Creating RC1] guide:
  - [ ] Create an PR on `develop` updating the `docs/admin/install.rst` guide (as needed).
  - [ ] Create an PR on `develop` updating the dependencies license list (as needed).

## Subsequent RCs

- Create additional release candidates as needed, using [Creating subsequent RCs] guide.

Keep in mind that:

1. After the feature freeze only regression and security fixes should be
   cherry-picked into stable branches.
2. The final RC should point to the same commit as the final release.
